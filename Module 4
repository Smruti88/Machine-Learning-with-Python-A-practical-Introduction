Which of the following is an application of clustering?-Customer segmentation
Which approach can be used to calculate dissimilarity of objects in clustering?-Cosine similarity,Euclidian distance,Minkowski distance.
How is a center point (centroid) picked for each cluster in k-means? (Select all that apply)-We can randomly choose some observations out of the data set and use these observations as the initial means.We can create some random points as centroids of the clusters.
